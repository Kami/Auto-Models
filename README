OmniGraffle diagram has no layout: objects are on top of each other.
Use "automatic layout" for initial positioning, then manually reposition
as necessary.

=== TODO ===

[ ] Add fields to diagram nodes

If requested:

[ ] Remove diN0-specific Django dependencies so people without sweet
Django setups can still use this off the shelf....once someone not me
wants to use this, that is :-)

[ ] GUI interface

[ ] other diagram formats

[ ] other code formats?
