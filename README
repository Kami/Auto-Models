[ ] Create Django models code from OmniGraffle diagram
[ ] Update Django models code from OmbniGraffle diagram

=== DEPENDENCIES ===

  OmniGraffle
  http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnigraffle/
  -> Mac-only software
  -> requires OmniGraffle
  -> requires appscript, python library for AppleScript
    sudo easy_install appscript
    http://appscript.sourceforge.net/py-appscript/doc/
    
  Django
  http://djangoproject.com

=== RUN ===

From command line:
    cd <Django project>

OmniGraffle diagram has no layout: objects are on top of each other.
Use "automatic layout" for initial positioning, then manually reposition
as necessary.

=== TODO ===

[x] Add fields to diagram nodes

If requested:

[ ] Remove diN0-specific Django dependencies so people (without sweet
Django setups) can use this off the shelf....once someone not me
wants to use this, that is :-)

[ ] GUI interface

[ ] other diagram formats

[ ] other code formats?
